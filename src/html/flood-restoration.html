            <p class="text-muted lead mb-0">
                When a home experiences flood damage caused by plumbing failures, it is essential to take immediate
                action to mitigate further damage. Flood restoration in such cases typically involves several steps.
                First, the water source must be shut off and any excess water removed. Then, the affected area needs to
                be thoroughly dried to prevent mold growth. Depending on the extent of the damage, restoration may
                involve repairing or replacing damaged plumbing, flooring, walls, and furniture. It's important to
                engage professional help during this process to ensure a thorough and efficient restoration and to
                minimize any long-term effects caused by the flood.</p>
