When I finally calmed down I did my research and called around to several companies, no one was willing to work with my insurance company or I had to pay a hefty out of pocket fee on top of my already high insurance deductible, that was until I found out about RAPID RESPONSE, these guys are fast, efficient, didn't even try to upsell me on anything, I was almost shocked! They will make sure your house is BETTER off then before you had a river running through it! Thank you Rapid Response!! :)",

It was super late, but they showed up immediately and got all the water cleared out. They worked with our insurance and took care of us from start to finish. They made the process so easy and painless for us. Thank you to the staff for taking care of our home!",
